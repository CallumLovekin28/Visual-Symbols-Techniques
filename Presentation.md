#Visual techniques (aka rhetorical devices) for non-literal communication

##Simile

##Metaphor

*A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable.*

##Metonym and synechoche

*A word, name, or expression used as a substitute for something else with which it is closely associated. For example, Washington is a metonym for the US government.*

*A figure of speech in which a part is made to represent the whole or vice versa, as in England lost by six wickets (meaning ‘ the English cricket team’).*

##Irony/Sarcasm

*The expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect.*

##Lies

*A false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.*
