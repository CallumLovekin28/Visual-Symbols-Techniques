#Visual techniques (aka rhetorical devices) for non-literal communication

##Metaphor/Similes

**A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable.**

**A figure of speech involving the comparison of one thing with another thing of a different kind, used to make a description more emphatic or vivid (e.g. as brave as a lion ).**

The idea of using chain links and having it broken brings visual appeal and is a great use of a metaphor to represent the slave.

The company have used their name to use a watermelon. The idea is nice and unique as no other company can really use it as they have different context with their owen branding. I like the fact they have used the layers of the watermelon to show skills. I think it would be better if they used their skills to show front web development and design as the skin and the php and MySQL as core.

The concept is simple and works as the mouth is open and it looks like the person is eating their words. The face has got some writing which shows nutritional information.

The conecpt is simple and shows the crescent with the elements of a creme.

I like the use of the simile here. The stacking effect of the tomatos add to the theory of growing which helps the overall concept.

This idea is great as it is used everyday. The overall product shows the countrys resources depleting slowly as a tissue is pulled out.

This idea was simple and conveyed a simple meaning of having just one birthday wish, the designer has shown this by adding just one coin into a jar and saying that was enough.

The scissors open helps with emphasising the slicing of elements from PSD/PNG to HTML.

![Process](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/Screen%20Shot%202016-11-03%20at%2019.40.35.png)

The process is exaggerated and shows metaphorical elements.

The composition of using a variety of photos to show the world map aids with the metaphorical use.


##Metonym and synecdoche

**A word, name, or expression used as a substitute for something else with which it is closely associated. For example, Washington is a metonym for the US government.**

**A figure of speech in which a part is made to represent the whole or vice versa, as in England lost by six wickets (meaning ‘ the English cricket team’).**

![Fork](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/metonymy.jpg)

Its clever as they have taken an element used in a daily basis, added a shap to make it look like a hand too, great use of metonymy

![Flags](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/metonymy-flags.jpg)

This is more contextual, it was the flags tied together. Pakistan and Palestinian flags tied together to signify peace.

##Irony/Sarcasm

**The expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite, typically for humorous or emphatic effect.**

![Smoking](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/2.jpg)

The background contrasts with the sign.

![Car](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/4.jpg)

The bumper shows a message saying "turn me over".

![Bird](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/8.jpg)

Simple, bird standing on a no bird sign.

![Cage](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/12.jpg)

Freedom written within the cage bounds.

![Food](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/13.jpg)

The two billboards contradict themselves.

![Coke](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/15.jpg)

Two rival soda providers coming out of the compeititons truck.

![Plane](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/16.jpg)

Ironic because people go there to learn how to fly, seeing the plane crash is not a great first sight to see.

![JDI](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/17.jpg)

I dont think they meant to wee on the side of the building however it is an interpretation.

![Colgate](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/18.jpg)

No teeth for toothpaste and no white in the same region of the mouth.

##Lies

**A false statement made with deliberate intent to deceive; an intentional untruth; a falsehood.**

![Computer](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/0f7cbfd799a836959366bec8b13eed5b.jpg)

Not busy, literally going hunting on facebook to stalk people.

![Gum](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/41643713646b9780f5ced4e67a3c1cbb.jpg)

Have a full pack however not willing to share.

![Dog](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/d8142821d0aa105312ad44cadb909fb5.jpg)

The contrast between the statements.

![Slice](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/88b494636a4b1d90d70c1789d4f4ae0a.jpg)

A trim is not 6" of the top.

![Coffee](https://github.com/CallumLovekin28/Visual-Symbols-Techniques/blob/master/Images/970222c6a78a7adce65c947e953087a3.jpg)

Symbol of a coffee mug to majortiy of the audiences however he was talking about a frappacino.
